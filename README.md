# SatelliteSwathWidth


Satellite swath width Java implementation Satellite swath width algorithm implementation in Java. The algorithm implemented calculates the latitude and longitude of a given satellite orbiting the Earth. The running code generates a list of coordinates that indicate the path which a satellite sensor is able to view according to the sensor configuration and the satellite settings. The generated coordinates accuracy were tested against STK simulations. Code developed as part of my 2 year internship at IEAv research institute.
